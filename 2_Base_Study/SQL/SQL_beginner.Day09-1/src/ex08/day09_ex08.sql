-- Language	SQL, DDL, DML
-- Please write a SQL or pl/pgsql function fnc_fibonacci (itâ€™s up to you) that has an input parameter pstop with type integer (by default is 10) and the function output is a table with all Fibonacci numbers less than pstop.

-- To check yourself and call a function, you can make a statements like below.

-- select * from fnc_fibonacci(100);
-- select * from fnc_fibonacci();

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fnc_fibonacci(pstop INTEGER DEFAULT 10)
RETURNS SETOF INTEGER AS 
$$
    WITH RECURSIVE t(a,b) AS 
    (VALUES(0,1)
    UNION ALL
    SELECT GREATEST(a,b), a + b AS a FROM t WHERE b < $1)
SELECT a FROM t;
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;

SELECT * FROM fnc_fibonacci(100);
SELECT * FROM fnc_fibonacci();
